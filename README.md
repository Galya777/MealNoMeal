# 🍽️ Meal or No Meal 🍽️

A **Deal or No Deal** style game built in **Go** with the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) GUI toolkit.  
Themed around food trays instead of briefcases, the game combines luck, strategy, and a bit of fun with random **bonuses**.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- 26 trays (`NUM_TRAYS = 26`) each contain a hidden **cash value** or **food item**.  
- At the start, the player selects **their tray** to keep until the end.  
- The player then opens trays one by one. Opened values are **crossed off** the sidebar.  
- Every 3 trays, the **Chef** (banker) makes an offer:
  - Either a **cash deal** based on remaining trays.
  - Or a **swap offer** to exchange your tray with another unopened tray.
- Bonuses may appear once per game:
  - **Multiplier** (×2, ×3, ÷2, etc.)
  - **Additive** (+1000, -500, etc.)
- When only **1 unopened tray remains** (besides the player’s), the Chef makes **one final offer** before the last reveal.
- Finally, the **player’s tray** is opened and the prize revealed!
